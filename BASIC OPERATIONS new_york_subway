--For this dataset, I will attempt to analyze subway ridership data to help improve the quality of the cityâ€™s public transportation
I'll use basic calculations in SQL to help make sense of this data.

--To find data on the change in weekly ridership from 2013 to 2014. I'll use query to subtract the number of riders in 2013 from the number of riders in 2014.

SELECT 
station_name, ridership_2013, ridership_2014,
ridership_2014 - ridership_2013 AS change_2014_raw --(represents the change in ridership from 2013 to 2014 in raw numbers)


 FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york_subway.subway_ridership_2013_present` ;

 --The results show the change in ridership from 2013 to 2014. The Atlantic Av - Barclays Ctr station gained an average of 1,774 riders per week.
 The 4 Av station lost 321 riders.

 --By including a basic calculation in the query, I get an idea of the change in ridership for each subway station in a given year.

 --The original dataset describes average weekly ridership for each individual year. I'll write a new query to find average weekly
 ridership for a longer period of time, such as the multi-year period from 2013-2016. 


SELECT
station_name,
ridership_2013,
ridership_2014,
ridership_2015,
ridership_2016,
(ridership_2013 + ridership_2014 + ridership_2015 + ridership_2016) / 4 AS average
FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york_subway.subway_ridership_2013_present` ;

--After running this query, I notice a few things. The results clearly show the trend in ridership at each station from 2013 to 2016. Weekly ridership at the Atlantic Av - Barclays Ctr station increased every year since 2013. 

--Further, for the years 2014, 2015, and 2016, weekly ridership at Atlantic Av - Barclays Ctr exceeded the overall average for the period 2013-2016 (listed in the average column).
