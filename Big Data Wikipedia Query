--Here, I run a quick sample Big Data query returning over 200,000 results. The results containing data on language, title and total views for each title.
--I used ORDER BY to sort view in descending order or from Highest to Lowest.

SELECT
language,
title,
SUM(views) AS views
FROM
`bigquery-samples.wikipedia_benchmark.Wiki10B`
WHERE
title LIKE '%Google%'
GROUP BY
language,
title
ORDER BY
views DESC;
