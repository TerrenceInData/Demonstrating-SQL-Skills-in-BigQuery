--To find out what routes are most popular with different user types I'll use CONCAT to create strings of recognizable route
names that can be counted and sorted.

SELECT
usertype,
CONCAT(start_station_name,"to", end_station_name) AS route,
COUNT(*) AS num_trips,
ROUND(AVG(CAST(tripduration AS int64)/60),2) AS duration

--Trip duration is in seconds, so I use CAST to count it as number with int64 and use AVG to divide by 60 seconds to get minutes and round it to 2 decimal
places labeling column as duration.

FROM
`bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips`

GROUP BY
start_station_name, end_station_name, usertype

ORDER BY
num_trips DESC

LIMIT 10
