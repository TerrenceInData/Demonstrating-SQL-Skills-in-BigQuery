-- To figure out which warehouses are delivering the most orders, I'll write a query to calculate what percentage of the orders are fulfilled by each warehouse.

SELECT
Warehouse.warehouse_id,
CONCAT(Warehouse.state, ': ', Warehouse.warehouse_alias) AS warehouse_name,
COUNT(Orders.order_id) AS number_of_orders,
(
  SELECT
  COUNT(*)
  FROM warehouse_orders.Orders Orders)
  AS total_orders,
  --I use a CASE statement to create categories for warehouses based on how many orders they will fulfill.
  CASE
  WHEN COUNT(Orders.order_id)/(SELECT COUNT (*) FROM warehouse_orders.Orders Orders) <= 0.20
  THEN "fulfilled 0-20% of Orders"
  WHEN COUNT(Orders.order_id)/(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM warehouse_orders.Orders Orders) > 0.20
  AND COUNT(Orders.order_id)/(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM warehouse_orders.Orders Orders) <= 0.60
  THEN "fulfilled 21-60% of Orders"
  ELSE "fulfilled more than 60% of Orders"
  END AS fulfillment_summary
  FROM warehouse_orders.Warehouse Warehouse
  LEFT JOIN warehouse_orders.Orders Orders
  ON Orders.warehouse_id = Warehouse.warehouse_id
  GROUP BY
  Warehouse.warehouse_id,
  warehouse_name

--To exclude new warehouses with no orders, I'll use HAVING to only include warehouses that have at least one order.
HAVING
COUNT(Orders.order_id) > 0

--After running query, I can easily identify what percent of our company's total orders are being fulfilled by each warehouse.
--This query has made a specific table of data that can be used to easily compare how these warehouses are performing.
