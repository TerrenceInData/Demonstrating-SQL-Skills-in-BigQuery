--I will run a query using INNER JOIN to join matching data from two different tables and join them together in 1 table.

--I can write a query to get a list of employees with their department name, excluding any employee without a department ID.
--The department ID record is used in both tables, so I can use an INNER JOIN to return a list with only those employees included in it.

SELECT 
employees.name AS employee_name,
employees.role AS employee_role,
departments.name AS department_name
FROM
employee_data.employees
INNER JOIN
employee_data.departments ON
employees.department_id = departments.department_id
;


--This query has correctly INNER JOINED each of the sought criterias intended for this table.

--Next, I will use OUTER JOIN which will fetch all of the employee names and departments together in 1 table.

--The query has run successfully, leaving nulls for fields with no values because of joined columns that don't have matching values.

employees.name AS employee_name,
employees.role AS employee_role,
