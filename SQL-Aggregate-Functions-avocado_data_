--First, I want to make sure I know how total is calculated. I need to see if total column is just small, large, and extra-large bags added together.
I'll add the values in those three columns together in a query and then compare them to the total bags column in the dataset.

SELECT
Date,
Region,
Small_Bags,
Large_Bags,
XLarge_Bags,
Total_Bags,
Small_Bags + Large_Bags + XLarge_Bags AS Total_Bags_Calc

FROM
avocado_data.avocado_prices;

-- When I compare the two columns showing the total number of bags, I can see that the values are the same. This lets me know the data is correct.
Now that the total number of bags is verified, I'll use this data for another query.

-- To help stakeholders make decisions on how to package avocados or which size bag to run a sale on.
I'll write a query to calculate what percent of the total number of bags were small bags.

SELECT
Date,
Region,
Small_Bags,
Total_Bags,
(Small_Bags / Total_Bags)*100 AS Small_Bags_Percent
FROM
avocado_data.avocado_prices
WHERE
Total_Bags <> 0;
